Analyze and fix the existing Catalyst Environment Inventory job end-to-end.

The current implementation is partially broken. Do not trust its existing processing/reconciliation logic. Use it only as a reference for the existing job/UI structure, then derive and implement the correct logic from the actual artifact data.

Data rules:
- Ignore CSV completely. JSON is the authoritative source.
- An application may contain:
  - JSON/
  - CSV/
  - optionally DB/
- DB/, when present, contains JSON files for database VMs and must also be processed.
- If DB/ does not exist, process only JSON/.
- The latest file is a complete state for an environment, but an application can contain multiple environments (for example Dev01, Dev02).
- Therefore, do NOT simply take the globally latest file.
- Do NOT rely solely on filename naming conventions because they are not consistent across applications.
- Determine the environments represented by the artifacts, correlate the historical files belonging to each environment, and identify the latest authoritative state for each environment.
- The final application state must be the combination of the latest state of every environment, including DB VMs where applicable.

Reference data:
- Two applications have already been downloaded locally and should be used as real reference datasets, including one application with DB/ and one without DB/.
- I will provide the Artifactory URLs for the other applications.
- HTTP access works without credentials. Do not use browser MCP/integration or require tokens/secrets. Use curl to list/download artifacts when needed.

Analyze the actual files first and determine:
- how environments are identified
- how historical files map to each environment
- how chronological ordering can reliably be established
- how the latest state for each environment is determined
- how DB JSON relates to the main JSON data
- VM identity and deduplication rules
- the fields required for Environment Summary and VM Inventory

Then replace/fix the existing processing logic with a generic implementation that works for the current applications and future applications following the same metadata structure. Do not hardcode environment names, VM names, subscription IDs, or application-specific filename patterns.

Keep the existing job/UI architecture where it is valid.

End-to-end requirements:
- Discover/download the required Artifactory JSON artifacts when the job runs.
- Determine the latest state per environment.
- Merge the environment states into the final application inventory.
- Generate the existing Environment Summary and VM Inventory tables.
- Include DB VMs when DB/ exists.
- Keep CSV ignored.
- Validate the actual output against the downloaded reference applications.
- Test at least one application with DB/ and one without DB/.
- Update the existing test cases to reflect the corrected logic.
- Run the relevant tests and execute the job end-to-end using the real HTTP artifact data where possible.
- Print/log the resulting summary and inventory so the output can be verified.

Do not commit changes.

At the end, report the discovered environment/versioning logic, the implemented reconciliation approach, files changed, tests executed, and actual end-to-end results.
