Implement the following three fixes in the existing Pega Log Streamer application.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
For local development/testing, I currently have only three log files containing actual data:
1. PegaUSAGE
2. PegaRULES
3. PegaCLUSTER

The other log files exist only as empty placeholder files with filenames and no content.

Do NOT create or infer parsers for the empty files. The implementation must work dynamically when real files are eventually populated, but for this task the actual log-format investigation must be based on the three representative files that contain data.

==================================================
1. FIX LOG PARSING / RECORD NORMALIZATION
==================================================

The current behavior is:

- PegaUSAGE is displaying correctly.
- Each individual log event appears as a separate log entry/line.
- PegaRULES and PegaCLUSTER are not displaying correctly.
- Large portions of those files are being treated as one large log record/line.
- The screenshots show that PegaRULES and PegaCLUSTER have a different structure from PegaUSAGE.
- Some records contain structured fields, *NA*-delimited data, brackets, JSON-like content, and potentially multiline content/stack traces.

Do NOT simply modify the existing parser to force every log type into the same format.

First inspect the actual contents and determine the real record boundaries and structure for:

- PegaUSAGE
- PegaRULES
- PegaCLUSTER

Determine exactly why PegaUSAGE works while PegaRULES and PegaCLUSTER are being merged into large records.

Specifically investigate whether the difference is caused by:

- newline/line-ending handling
- different record delimiters
- multiline records
- the existing five-bracket parsing assumption
- *NA*-delimited fields
- JSON/structured messages
- stack traces
- or another format-specific characteristic

Then implement a lightweight parser/normalization layer.

The desired architecture is:

RAW LOG FILE
    ↓
FORMAT / RECORD-BOUNDARY DETECTION
    ↓
FORMAT-SPECIFIC PARSER
    ↓
NORMALIZED LOG ENTRY
    ↓
EXISTING SEARCH / FILTER / PAGINATION / STREAMING
    ↓
UI

Each parser should produce a common normalized representation, such as:

- timestamp
- log level
- pod/source
- message
- raw/original record
- existing metadata already supported by the application

The important point is that the UI and filtering layer should operate on normalized log records rather than knowing the syntax of each individual Pega log format.

Requirements:

- Do not hardcode filenames.
- Do not hardcode pod names.
- Do not hardcode namespaces.
- Do not hardcode the sample log contents.
- Do not assume every Pega log uses the same five-bracket structure.
- Do not use newline
