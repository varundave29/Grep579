Keep the existing local/windows/*.ps1 scripts unchanged.

Create equivalent Bash shell scripts for Windows Git Bash:

- local/windows/start.sh
- local/windows/stop.sh
- local/windows/restart.sh

First inspect the existing PS1 scripts and local/windows/environment.local. Treat the PS1 implementation as the behavioral reference and preserve the same lifecycle functionality, but implement it natively in Bash. Do NOT invoke the PS1 scripts.

The .sh scripts must:
- Work from Git Bash on Windows.
- Use the Windows-specific configuration and paths from local/windows/environment.local.
- Start, stop, and restart the application reliably.
- Handle the Windows Python/runtime differences from the Linux target VM.
- Avoid hardcoded user-specific paths.
- Preserve the core application/platform-agnostic design.
- Keep Linux VM and Kubernetes deployment behavior unaffected.

Create/update local/changes.md documenting the meaningful Windows-vs-Linux differences and why the Windows Bash launcher exists.

IMPORTANT: Do not just create or syntax-check the scripts. Actually execute them in Git Bash and validate the complete lifecycle:

1. Run start.sh and verify the application is genuinely running and reachable.
2. Run stop.sh and verify the process actually stops.
3. Run start.sh again and verify it starts successfully.
4. Run restart.sh and verify the old process is stopped and a new process starts.
5. Verify PID handling, port handling, logs, orphan processes, and startup/shutdown errors.

Fix any issues discovered during execution and retest until all three .sh scripts work successfully.

Do not consider the task complete until real execution has been demonstrated for start.sh, stop.sh, and restart.sh.
