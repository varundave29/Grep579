Build a lightweight Pega Log Viewer into the existing utility using the existing NAS-mounted log directory as the source.

Core flow

NAS:
/Pega/logs/<environment>/<tier>/<pod>/...

The utility runs on the same Red Hat VM and already has access to the NAS.

Build a web-based live log viewer using the existing FastAPI backend and frontend architecture.

Log selection

Provide cascading selectors:

* Environment
* Tier: WEB / BATCH / SRS / etc.
* Pod: individual pod or ALL PODS
* Log type: alert / rules / batch / web / etc.

When ALL PODS is selected, stream the same log type from all matching pods and merge the entries chronologically by timestamp.

Every log entry must contain:

timestamp | log level | pod name | message

Example:

08:41:23 | ERROR | batch-7f8d9 | PEGA-1234 database timeout

Multi-line entries (stack traces)

Many log lines, especially ERROR/FATAL, span multiple physical lines, e.g. Java stack traces.

A new entry begins only when a line matches the expected timestamp/level prefix for that log type. Any line that does not match this prefix must be appended to the message of the previous entry rather than treated as a new entry on its own.

The log parser must support a per-log-type line-format definition (timestamp pattern, level pattern, message start), since alert, rules, batch, and web logs may not share an identical line format.

Search and rule-engine matching must run against the fully assembled multi-line message, not against individual raw physical lines.

Pod identification

Assign each pod a consistent UI color for the duration of the viewing session.

If a pod restarts and gets a new pod name, treat the new pod as a new pod identity and assign it a new color.

The pod label must always be visible so users can immediately identify which pod generated the message.

Log-level colors

Use separate visual indicators/colors for:

* INFO
* DEBUG
* WARN
* ERROR
* FATAL

Do not rely only on text color. Keep the UI readable in both light and dark themes.

Live streaming

Use WebSocket for live streaming.

When a log is opened:

1. Load the latest ~100 lines.
2. Continue streaming new lines live.
3. Support Pause / Resume.
4. Support auto-scroll to bottom.
5. Allow the user to scroll backwards into previously loaded content.

Do not poll the backend continuously when WebSocket streaming is possible.

Historical logs (V2 - deferred)

For this version, the viewer works only with the current/live log file for the selected environment/tier/pod/log type. Do not implement navigation into older .tar.gz archives on the NAS yet, and do not implement any chronological merge across historical data.

This is deferred to a later version and will include: seamless navigation from the current log into previous-day and older archives, incremental extraction of only the needed file from an archive without extracting the whole archive or loading it fully into memory, and a temporary per-session workspace on the VM for any extracted content with cleanup on session end/timeout. Keep the current design modular enough that this can be added later without reworking the live-tail path.

Search and filtering

Provide:

* Free-text search
* Regex search
* Case-sensitive option
* Log-level filters: ALL / DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR / FATAL
* Clear filters

Support time scope:

* Live
* Today (current file only)
* Historical (V2 - deferred, once archive support is added)
* All available logs (V2 - deferred, once archive support is added)

For historical searches (V2), search the relevant archive files without loading all historical logs into memory.

Regex safety: Google RE2 is not available in this environment. Use the third-party "regex" Python package (a drop-in replacement for the standard "re" module) instead of stdlib re for any user-supplied pattern, and pass its timeout parameter on every call, e.g. regex.search(pattern, text, timeout=0.5), so a pathological or expensive expression is aborted rather than blocking the server. Surface a clear message to the user if a search times out rather than failing silently.

Error/rule detection

Implement a configurable rule engine for predefined patterns.

Example configuration:

rules:
  - name: Pega Error
    pattern: "PEGA-[0-9]+"
    severity: ERROR
  - name: Database Error
    pattern: "(?i)ORA-[0-9]+"
    severity: ERROR
  - name: Timeout
    pattern: "(?i)timeout|timed out"
    severity: WARN

Allow matched entries to be highlighted and optionally surfaced as detected events.

Rule matching must run against the fully assembled log message, including any stitched multi-line content, not against raw individual physical lines.

Keep the rule engine independent from the log streaming implementation so notification mechanisms can be added later.

Backend architecture

Keep components separated:

* Log discovery
* Log source/path resolution
* Live file watcher
* Archive reader (V2 - deferred)
* Log parser (must support per-log-type line formats and multi-line/stack-trace stitching)
* Search/filter engine
* Rule engine
* Session/resource manager
* WebSocket streaming

Do not introduce Elasticsearch, Kafka, OpenSearch, Logstash, or another external logging platform.

The filesystem/NAS remains the source of truth.

Multi-user support

Design the viewer as a multi-user application.

Each active viewer must have an isolated session:

session -> selected environment/tier/pod/log -> WebSocket (temporary workspace applies once archive support in V2 is added)

Do not create a global in-memory copy of log files.

Multiple users viewing the same log should reuse the underlying file-reading mechanism where practical instead of creating unnecessary duplicate readers.

Implement:

* Connection/session cleanup
* Bounded memory buffers
* Maximum concurrent streams/configurable limits
* Backpressure for slow clients
* Automatic stale-session cleanup
* No memory leak when users repeatedly open/close logs

API design

Keep APIs clean and RESTful for discovery/search and WebSocket for streaming.

Example:

GET /api/environments
GET /api/environments/{env}/tiers
GET /api/logs?environment=DEV&tier=BATCH
POST /api/logs/search
WS  /ws/logs/{session_id}

Return log entries as structured JSON rather than raw strings:

{
  "timestamp": "2026-09-16T08:41:23.123",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "pod": "batch-7f8d9",
  "log": "alert.log",
  "message": "PEGA-1234 database timeout"
}

The frontend should handle rendering, pod colors, log-level indicators, filtering and highlighting.

Important constraints

Prioritize low memory usage, low latency and safe concurrent access.

Never load an entire live log or archive into memory.

Never modify files on the NAS.

Use the existing local job/artifact workspace for temporary processing.

Keep the implementation modular so additional log types, environments, notification channels and advanced analytics can be added later.

First inspect the existing utility's backend/frontend structure and integrate this feature into the current architecture rather than creating a separate application.
